eZCurlGateway extension v1.0.0 FAQ

1. eZCurlGateway is not activated in eZ publish
=================================================

You will need to check if the extension is properly activated in site.ini.
Edit `settings/override/site.ini.append' or `settings/override/site.ini.append.php'
and find the `ExtensionSettings' group. Under it you should have an entry
that says:

ActiveExtensions[]=ezcurlgateway

Make sure there are no spaces before or after the name.

You should also consider checking the debug output 
of eZ publish to see what is going wrong.


2. eZCurlGateway requires a form element called "validate"
=================================================

In order for eZCurlGateway to automatically call the 
validateForm function, you must name one of your 
form elements (such as the submit button) "validate".

3. eZCurlGateway class and the $useForm class variable
=================================================

In the begining of the eZCurlGateway class there is a variable
called $useForm. Override $useForm as false if you do not need 
to gather additional user information before you send the curl 
information (although I can't think of many situations in which 
this would happen, let me know if you actually use it, otherwise 
I might just take it out.

Example:    var $useForm = true;
