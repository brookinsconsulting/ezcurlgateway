Installing eZCurlGateway extension
==============================================

1. Copy the package into the `extension' directory 
   in the root of your eZ publish installation.

2. Unpack the files in the distribution. The command 
   necessary is depends on the file you downloaded.
   [tar.gz]:
   $ tar -zxvf ezcurlgateway-1_0_1.tar.gz
   [zip]:
   $ unzip ezcurlgateway-1_0_1.tar.zip

3. We must now enable the extension in eZ publish. 
   To do this edit site.ini.append(.php) in the folder 
   root_of_ezpublish/settings. If this file does not exist; 
   create it. Locate (or add) the block 

   [ExtensionSettings] and add the line:
   ActiveExtensions[]=ezcurlgateway

   If you run several sites using only one distribution 
   and only some of the sites should use the extension, 
   make the changes in the override file of that siteaccess.
 
   E.g root_of_ezpublish/settings/siteaccess/news/site.ini.append(.php)
   But instead of using ActiveExtensions you must add these lines instead:

   [ExtensionSettings]
   ActiveAccessExtensions[]=ezcurlgateway
